Zen C7 Base (Docker)
====================

This will build a base CentOS 7 image based on the Docker.io CentOS 7.2.1511 which is used by all of my CentOS 7 based Docker container projects.

Requirements
------------

As this is based on the Docker.io CentOS image, you will need that image in order to build this one:

- Docker.io CentOS 7 Base:
  CentOS 7.2.1511 / docker pull docker.io/centos:7.2.1511
